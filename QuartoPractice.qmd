# Set up working environment

We will be using **ggplot2** and **tidyverse** in this practice. Make you have these packages installed before moving on. We will use the **diamonds** data in the package.

You can embed coode like this:

```{r}
#install.packages("tidyverse")
#install.packages("ggplot2")

library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
data("diamonds")
head(diamonds)
```

# Making a graph in Quarto

Now let's try making a graph

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=carat, y=price, color=cut)) + geom_point()
```

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code.
